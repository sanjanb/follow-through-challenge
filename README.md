# ✦ 28-Day Follow-Through Challenge ✦

*Not another habit tracker. A proof system that rebuilds your self-trust.*

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open `index.html`** in your browser
2. **Start tracking** your daily baseline items
3. **Complete Week 1** to unlock Week 2, and so on
4. **Build momentum** through consistent small wins

## 📋 Daily Baseline (Days 1–28)

Do these 7 non-negotiables **EVERY day**. No exceptions:

1. **Sleep 6+ hours** - Track bedtime/wake time
2. **60+ min phone-free** - Before 10am OR after 8pm
3. **Write 1 win** - Tiny counts: "made bed," "said no"
4. **Zero major lies** - To yourself or others
5. **Move 10+ min** - Walk, stretch, dance—no gym required
6. **1 intentional decision** - Not reactive scrolling/eating
7. **Check yesterday's commitment** - Did you finish it?

*Miss 2 days in a row? Reset the 28-day count. This isn't punishment—it's respect for your word.*
